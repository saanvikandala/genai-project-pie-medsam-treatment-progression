Gen AI Project: PIE-MedSAM: Simulating Disease Treatment Progression Via Progressive Image Editing And ROI-Aware Feedback

Our project adapts the work done in the PIE: Simulating Disease Progression via Progressive Image Editing paper to fine-tune PIE for generating image-level progressive images to simulate treatment progression in glioblastoma tumor MRI scans.
